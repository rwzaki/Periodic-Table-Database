# Periodic-Table-Database

This project is one of the required projects within the relational database course at freecodecamp. The main three tasks in this project are:


## **1. Fixing the database.**

**Files:** _periodic_table.sql_

In this task, we were asked to perform certain modifications into the database using PostgreSQL. Examples of these modifications are renaming column, adding constraints, adding foreign keys, creating tables, inserting data, and updataing table (```INITCAPS()``` was used too). 


## **2. Creating Git Repository fo the project.**

**Files:** _git_commits.txt_

Within this part, the whole project was performed within a repository that was created in CodeAlly's terminal. Therefore, for some reason there was some restrictions to push the repo to a remote one. The git_commits.txt is a file that was created by redirecting stdout of ```git log --oneline > git_commits.txt```. Text files holds tha commits that were made within project.

## **3. Creating the shell script.**

**Files:** _element.sh, periodic_table.sql_

In this task, a bash program is prepared to get user input which might be either atomic number, element symbol, or element name, and outputs a message with the element's information. The periodic table database is used for searching the inputted elemnt identifer to get its details (again from the databse it self).
